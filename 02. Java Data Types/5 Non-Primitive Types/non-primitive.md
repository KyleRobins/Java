# Java Non-Primitive Data Types

## Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between `primitive` and `non-primitive` data types are:

- Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.

> Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.
