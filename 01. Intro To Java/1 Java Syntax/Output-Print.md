# Java Output / Print

## Print Text 
We use the `println()` method to print or output values to the screen

**Example**
```java
System.out.println("Output to the screen");
```

You can add as many `println()` methods to your `main class`. Note that each method adds a new line to the screen.

**Example**
```java
System.out.println("Output to the screen");
System.out.println("Output Second line to the screen");
System.out.println("Output Third line to the screen");
```

## Double Qoutes `""`

When working with text, it must be wrapped inside `""` double quatation marks. Incase you leave it out errors occur

**Example**
```java
System.out.println("This Will Work");
Sytem.out.println("This Will Not Work");
```

## The Print() Method

Apart from the `println()` method  there is the `print()` method. The difference being the `print()` method does not print a new line, Instead it prints in the same line.

**Example**
```java
System.out.print("Text one ");
System.out.print("Text Two"); // Output:Text one Text Two
```
