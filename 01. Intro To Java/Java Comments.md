# Java Comments
Comments can be used to explain Java code, comments are not executed at compilation. They can also be used to comment out code that is not required at the moment and can be used for future refference.
## Single-line Comments `//`
Single line comments start with two forward slashes `(//)`. Any Text that follows the `//` forward slashes in the same line will not be executed, it will get treated as a comment.

**Example**

```java
// a single line comment 
System.out.println("Java Comments");
System.out.println("This is also a comment"); // Another comment
```
## Java Multi-line Comments `/* */`

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/` any text between the two is treated a comment and java will ignore it at compilation.

**Example** 

```Java
/* The code below prints 
multi-line comments to the screen */
System.out.println("Multi-line Comments");
```
